This is pretty basic tutorial to start off with **Convolutional networks**.\n\nLet's start with a bit of introduction Convolutional neural networks are primarily used to classify images or identify pattern similarities between them. So a convolutional network receives a normal color image as a rectangular box whose width and height are measured by the number of pixels along those dimensions, and whose depth is three layers deep, one for each letter in RGB. Those depth layers are referred to as **channels**. For simplification needs we will only consider gray scale image here.\n\nAs images move through a convolutional network, different patterns are recognised just like a normal neural network. But here rather than focussing on one pixel at a time, a convolutional net takes in square patches of pixels and passes them through a **filter**. That filter is also a square matrix smaller than the image itself, and equal in size to the patch. It is also called a **kernel**.\n![](https://ahmedbesbes.com/images/GIF.gif)\n\n\nWell that's it with the theory let's get started with the practical.\n\n\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"52ba7940f430ddbcfe5c608e3fac6d969f89b836"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n**Import Libraries**\n\nThere are basically 4 type of libraries which you have to import\n\n1.

Tensorflow Keras layers :- Every NN needs layers and CNN needs well a couple of layers.\n\nLayers needed by CNN\n1. Conv2D :- Basic Convolutional layer . Here we will be using a 64 neuron layer\n2. Dense :- Dense layer is needed by every neural network to finally output the result however every once in while using a Dense layer helps in making model learn.\n3. MaxPooling :- CNN has a concept of max pooling. After every convoulution we get some values in a kernel. However in max pooling we select max kernel value.\n4. Flatten:- Conv2D layer returns doesn't return a flatten data hence we need Flatten layer before feeding it into final Dense layer\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"be4e519695677a33858690096ddc849c25130a47"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport cv2\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten, Dropout, Activation, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\n\nimport zipfile\n\nwith zipfile.ZipFile(\"../input/train.zip\",\"r\") as z:\n    z.extractall(\".\")\n    \nwith zipfile.ZipFile(\"../input/test1.zip\",\"r\") as z:\n    z.extractall(\".\")\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.\n\n#print(os.listdir(\"/kaggle/working/train\"))","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-11T10:20:18.202165Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-11T10:20:18.202439Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-11T10:20:36.083199Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-11T10:20:18.202391Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-11T10:20:36.082499Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We need to train a model first so we will check training data In the below code we are iterating through all images in train folder and then we will split image name with deliminiter \".\" We have names like dog.0, dog.1, cat.2 etc..

Define a Sequential model\n2. Start adding layers to it.\n3. First we will add a Conv2D layer with 64 nodes and kernel size of (3,3). You can also experiment with different values here like 32, 128 etc. Also we have to specify input shape which is your X shape. Activation we will take 'relu' for now however there are many others to experiment with.\n4. Now after every Conv layer we always do max pooling so we will add max pooling layer with a size of (2,2) \n5. We will repeat this combination again because come on 2 is better than one. Haha. We you can also add 3 or more convolution layers but keep in mind the more layers you add more time it will take to train.\n6. But we don't have much time so we will add a flatten layer now. As we have to feed our data to Dense layer later.\n7. We will now add a Dense layer of 64 nodes. Note for all these layers we are using activation as 'relu' because I found results better with this. You can skip specifying activation but this might make a model a conveniently linear which might not work for us.\n8. In the end for getting our result we will add final Dense layer . Activation can be sigmoid or softmax (if you need probability use sigmoid else use softmax). Here I have used sigmoid.\n9. Finally we will compile the model . There are 3 things to mention here . Loss, Optimizer, Metrics\n\n**Loss** :- To make our model better we either minimize loss or maximize accuracy. NN always minimize loss. To measure it we can use different formulas like 'categorical_crossentropy' or 'binary_crossentropy'. Here I have used binary_crossentropy\n\n**Optimizer** :- If you know a lil bit about mathematics of machine learning you might be familier with local minima or global minima or cost function. To minimize cost function we use different methods For ex :- like gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent. So these are call optimizers. We are using a default one here which is **adam**\n\n**Metrics** :- This is to denote the measure of your model. Can be accuracy or some other metric.\n        ","metadata":{"_uuid":"47bf804edac40561e5c9d13e2a6f29e96ff31ecd"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"model = Sequential()\n# Adds a densely-connected layer with 64 units to the model:\nmodel.add(Conv2D(64,(3,3), activation = 'relu', input_shape = X.shape[1:]))\nmodel.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size = (2,2)))\n# Add another:\nmodel.add(Conv2D(64,(3,3), activation = 'relu'))\nmodel.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size = (2,2)))\n\nmodel.add(Flatten())\nmodel.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))\n# Add a softmax layer with 10 output units:\nmodel.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))\n\nmodel.compile(optimizer=\"adam\",\n              loss='binary_crossentropy',\n              metrics=['accuracy'])","metadata":{"_uuid":"80c4b5ece66f7a069cfb6194779dc02ef76ce3e8","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-11T10:21:29.230431Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-11T10:21:29.230726Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-11T10:21:29.426359Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-11T10:21:29.230675Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-11T10:21:29.425710Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now we will fit our model with training data.\n\nEpochs :- How many times our model will go through data\n\nBatch size :- How much amount of data at once you wanna pass through the model\n\nvalidation_split :- How much amount of data (in this case its 20 %) you will need to check cross validation error","metadata":{"_uuid":"0f7a138933cea22e5d6ebb8098e3d5728d47740e"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"model.fit(X, y, epochs=1, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)","metadata":{"_uuid":"ec02e9538761ef147ba6e0c2129dba117a37efa1","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-11T10:22:05.268967Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-11T10:22:05.269238Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-11T10:22:10.451395Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-11T10:22:05.269190Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-11T10:22:10.450742Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now we have to preporcess our test data also same as that our training data.","metadata":{"_uuid":"351552012321cc626c0177be12aee5c797ea72df"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_dir = \"test1\"\npath = os.path.join(main_dir,train_dir)\n#os.listdir(path)\n\nX_test = []\nid_line = []\ndef create_test1_data(path):\n    for p in os.listdir(path):\n        id_line.append(p.split(\".\")[0])\n        img_array = cv2.imread(os.path.join(path,p),cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)\n        new_img_array = cv2.resize(img_array, dsize=(80, 80))\n        X_test.append(new_img_array)\ncreate_test1_data(path)\nX_test = np.array(X_test).reshape(-1,80,80,1)\nX_test = X_test/255","metadata":{"_uuid":"6b55df2d3396f6d27d4e5d4ea4584a9e1733bc92","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-11T10:22:12.655702Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-11T10:22:12.655990Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-11T10:22:23.054395Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-11T10:22:12.655942Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-11T10:22:23.053568Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Ok.
